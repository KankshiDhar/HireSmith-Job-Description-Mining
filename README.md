The project intends to analyze the job descriptions stored for a large number of job
listings by the office of career services in their 12Twenty platform. The Job descriptions
are unstructured text with useful information such as skills, degree requirements etc
specified in each listing. The purpose of the project is to identify such skills, trends and
minimum degree requirements over the years from 2011 to 2020.


The Office of Career Services (OCS) at University of Marylandâ€™s, Robert H. Smith
School of Business, uses a platform known as HireSmith powered by 12Twenty. It is
primarily used as a tool for employers to post full-time, part- time, internship jobs for
students. The expired job listings are then stored and archived for analytical purposes.
The data stored has both structured and unstructured data. The OCS department has
aggregated data from their legacy (GradLeaders) and new system(12Twenty) to identify
the number of jobs posted, the categories of business and industry functions they
belong to, data of job posting on the portal and many such details.
The portal contains data spanning from Fall 2011 to Spring 2020, which can be used to
determine frequency of jobs from different domains, trends and patterns of job skills
required in different industries, work authorization requirements, degree requirements
etc. Our project scope deals with mining unstructured job description data to discover
potential trends in the current job market. This information will potentially help our client
to provide information on job related trends and technologies to help best prepare
students and inform the career coaches about the changing job landscape.
The stakeholders of this system are the Office of Career Services, Career coaches
